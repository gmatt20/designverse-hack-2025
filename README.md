Our DESIGNVERSE project is a environmentally friendly ocean cleanup app meant to pair ocean cleanup organizations with users to participate in ocean cleanup.
The user participates in ocean cleanups ran by local organizations that it displays and rewards points for participating which you
can redeem in the shop using our credits such as t-shirts, mugs, etc.. and is sponsored by organizations who want their cleanups to
show up the highest or donations to our organization.
